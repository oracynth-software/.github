**Preserving the past, enriching the present, and supporting the future of memory.**

Oracynth is building AI-powered tools to help families capture, organize, and preserve life stories across generations. Our platform combines multi-modal data extraction, intelligent narrative generation, and a conversational agent named Cynthia to assist users in curating digital archives with minimal effort and maximum meaning.
